# BasicExcelFuctionalities
In this project, I used some of the basic and important features of Excel. I have coverd:
1.  Excel fundamentals:
	- Arithmetic operations
	- Auto fill
	- Absolute and relative cell references
	- Created budget for a company and a family and visualized that with pie chart
	- Used some built-in functions, as SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX
	- Calculated and showed average rainfall of a city using line and clustered column chart
	- Sorting
	- Used Goal Seek to adust a result by varying input value.
	- IF function
2.	Nested IF and VLOOKUP
	- Multiple IF functions can be nested together to allow for multiple criteria. Here I used nested IF to calculate students' grade. 
	- I used Vlookup to make a table with an overview of all the grades for all students.
